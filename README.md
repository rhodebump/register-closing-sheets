register-closing-sheets
=======================

This is my first node.js application.  It uses google oauth2 for authentication.  It uses express.

This application provides a web-form with several fields on it that is a register closing sheet.  Fields include sales tax, sales, cash, all the fields you need to do a closing sheet.  There is some jquery that is used for the calculations so that everything balances out.
